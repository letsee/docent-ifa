          <h3>The Last Supper</h3>
          <div class="scrollbar-inner">
            <div class="textCell">
              <p>The Last Supper of Leonardo da Vinci (Cenacolo Vinciano) is one of the most famous paintings in the
                world. This artwork was painted between 1494 and 1498 under the government of Ludovico il Moro and
                represents the last "dinner" between Jesus and his disciples. In order to create this unique work,
                Leonardo carried out an exhaustive research creating an infinity of preparatory sketches. Leonardo
                abandons the traditional method of fresco painting, painting the scene "dry" on the wall of the
                refectory. Traces of gold and silver foils have been found which testify to the artist's willingness to
                make the figures in a much more realistic manner, including precious details. After completion, his
                technique and environmental factor had contributed to the eventual deterioration of the fresco, which
                had undergone numerous restorations. The most recent restoration was completed in 1999 where several
                scientific methods were used to restore the original colors as close as possible, and to eliminate
                traces of paint applied in previous attempts to restore the fresco.</p>
              <p>What is the Leonardo's Last Supper nowadays?<br>
                Leonardo's Last Supper is located in its original place, on the wall of the dining room of the former
                Dominican convent of Santa Maria delle Grazie, exactly in the refectory of the convent and is one of the
                most celebrated and well known artworks in the world.</p>
              <p>Leonardo Da Vinci's "Last Supper", a huge painting of 4.60 meters high and 8.80 meters wide was made
                with tempera and oil on a gypsum preparation instead of the technique commonly used in the fresco
                period.</p>
              <p>Several measures have now been implemented to protect the paint from deterioration. To ensure that the
                fresco is maintained at room temperature, since the last restoration, visitor's' entry has been
                restricted to a group of 25 people every 15 minutes.</p>
              <p>Curiosities about the Leonardo's Last Supper<br>
                Did you know that the great fame of this masterpiece has awaken the interest of many historians,
                researchers and novelists who seek to solve the supposed mysteries and enigmas that surround this
                painting. For example, in the books "The Templar Revelation" by Clive Prince and Lynn Picknett and in
                the novel Dan Brown's Da Vinci Code, it is affirmed that the figure to the right of Jesus is not the
                apostle John, but a female figure. The truth is that these mysteries and curiosities have not yet been
                solved.</p>
              <p>Did you know that during the French Revolutionary War Napoleon's troops used the wall of the refectory
                to make target practice and during the Second World War in 1943 the bombings managed to tear off the
                roof of the old Dominican dining room leaving the paint in the open for several years.</p>

            <div class="textCell">
              <p>Leonardo di ser Piero da Vincimore commonly Leonardo da Vinci or simply Leonardo, was an Italian
                polymath of the Renaissance whose areas of interest included invention, drawing, painting, sculpting,
                architecture, science, music, mathematics,engineering, literature, anatomy, geology, astronomy, botany,
                writing, history, and cartography.</p>
              <p>He has been variously called the father of palaeontology, ichnology, and architecture, and he is widely
                considered one of the greatest painters of all time. Sometimes credited with the inventions of the
                parachute, helicopter, and tank, he epitomised the Renaissance humanist ideal.</p>

            <div class="textCell">
              <p>Tempera (Italian: [ˈtɛmpera]), also known as egg tempera, is a permanent, fast-drying painting medium
                consisting of colored pigments mixed with a water-soluble binder medium, usually glutinous material such
                as egg yolk. Tempera also refers to the paintings done in this medium. Tempera paintings are very long
                lasting, and examples from the first century CE still exist. Egg tempera was a primary method of
                painting until after 1500 when it was superseded by the invention of oil painting. A paint consisting of
                pigment and binder commonly used in the United States as poster paint is also often referred to as
                "tempera paint", although the binders in this paint are different from traditional tempera paint.</p>

                    <p>"Nathanael, believed to be the disciple Bartholomew, experienced a jarring first encounter with
                      Jesus. When the apostle Philip called him to come and meet the Messiah, Nathanael was skeptical,
                      but he followed along anyway. As Philip introduced him to Jesus, the Lord declared, "Here is a
                      true Israelite, in whom there is nothing false." Immediately Nathanael wanted to know, "How do you
                      know me?"
                      Jesus got his attention when he answered, "I saw you while you were still under the fig tree
                      before Philip called you." Well, that stopped Nathanael in his tracks. Shocked and surprised he
                      declared, "Rabbi, you are the Son of God; you are the King of Israel."</p>

                  <div class="scrollbar-inner">

                      to heaven.
                      In Twelve Ordinary Men, John MacArthur suggests that his obscurity may have been the
                      distinguishing mark of his life. Discover why James the Less' complete anonymity may reveal

                  <div class="scrollbar-inner">
                    <p>"Without question, the apostle Peter was a "duh"-ciple most people can identify with. One minute
                      he was walking on water by faith, and the next he was sinking in doubt. Impulsive and emotional,
                      Peter is best known for denying Jesus when the pressure was on. Even so, as a disciple he was
                      dearly loved by Christ, holding a special place among the twelve.
                      Peter, a spokesman for the twelve, stands out in the Gospels. Whenever the men are listed, Peter's
                      name is first. He, James, and John formed the inner circle of Jesus' closest companions. These
                      three alone were given the privilege of experiencing the transfiguration, along with a few other
                      extraordinary revelations of Jesus."</p>

                  <div class="scrollbar-inner">
                    <p>"The apostle Thomas is often referred to as "Doubting Thomas" because he refused to believe that
                      Jesus had risen from the dead until he saw and touched Christ's physical wounds. As far as
                      disciples go, however, history has dealt Thomas a bum rap. After all, each of the 12 apostles,
                      except John, abandoned Jesus during his trial and death at Calvary.
                      Thomas was prone to extremes. Earlier he had demonstrated courageous faith, willing to risk his
                      own life to follow Jesus into Judea. There is an important lesson to be gained from studying
                      Thomas: If we're truly seeking to know the truth, and we're honest with ourselves and others about
                      our struggles and doubts, God will faithfully meet us and reveal himself to us, just as he did for
                      Thomas."</p>

                      but John didn't mind. He knew his mission was to point people to the Messiah.
                      Like many of us, Andrew lived in the shadow of his more famous sibling, Simon Peter. Andrew led
                      Peter to Christ, then stepped into the background as his boisterous brother became a leader among
                      the apostles and in the early church.
                      The Gospels don't tell us a great deal about Andrew, but reading between the lines reveals a
                      person who thirsted for truth and found it in the living water of Jesus. Discover how a simple
                      fisherman dropped his nets on the shore and went on to become a remarkable fisher of men."</p>

                      some would say Judas Iscariot made the greatest error in history.
                      Down through time, people have had mixed feelings about Judas. Some experience a sense of hatred
                      toward him, others feel pity, and some have even considered him a hero. No matter how you react to

                  <div class="scrollbar-inner">
                    <p>"The apostle John, brother to James, was nicknamed by Jesus one of the "sons of thunder," but he
                      liked to call himself "the disciple whom Jesus loved." With his fiery temperament and special
                      devotion to the Savior, he gained a favored place in Christ's inner circle.
                      John's enormous impact on the early Christian church and his larger-than-life personality, make
                      him a fascinating character study. His writings reveal contrasting traits. For instance, on the
                      first Easter morning, with his typical zeal and enthusiasm, John raced Peter to the tomb after
                      Mary Magdalene reported that it was now empty. Although John won the race and bragged about this
                      achievement in his Gospel (John 20:1-9), he humbly allowed Peter to enter the tomb first.
                      According to tradition, John outlived all of the disciples, dying of old age in Ephesus, where he
                      preached a gospel of love and taught against heresy."</p>

                      of thunder" — they were privileged to be at the front and center of three supernatural events in
                      the life of Christ. In addition to these honors, James was the first of the twelve to be martyred

                      countrymen.
                      But when Matthew the dishonest tax collector heard two words from Jesus, "Follow me," he left
                      everything and obeyed. Like us, he longed to be accepted and loved. Matthew recognized Jesus as

                      Scripture tells us almost nothing about Simon. In the Gospels, he is mentioned in three places,
                      but only to list his name. In Acts 1:13 we learn that he was present with the apostles in the
                      upper room of Jerusalem after Christ had ascended to heaven. Beyond those few details, we can only
                      speculate about Simon and his designation as a Zealot."</p>
